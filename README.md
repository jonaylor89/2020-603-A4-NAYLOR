# CMSC 603 Assignment 4 Spark

John Naylor

### abstract
 
 For the final piece of the long going journey to understand the relationship between algorithms and their parallel counterparts, a parallel version of KNN written using Apache Spark, a unified analytics engine for large scale data processing, and compared against the parallel implementations from previous assignments (i.re. Sync, MPI, CUDA, and Hadoop). For small datasets, the data shows the the version runs with similar run times as the Hadoop implementations. Unforunately, with large datasets, the Spark implementation runs much slower than another other method tested.
